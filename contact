Morning Ryan! 

I spoke with Rui Du, branch manager out of Carlyle. Rui is a strong advocate for budgeting and mentorship. 
  He is delighted to be a part of the project and support this student. I know he’s in Carlyle but I can assure you, 
  he’s amazing, winning numerous awards internally for his community work and leadership. 

Rui (pronounced Ray) can be reached at Rui.Du@rbc.com or phone 306-453-3291. 

I will let him know you will be reaching out. Please feel free to cc me should you wish. Finally, 
  if your student needs a test subject, always happy to try it out lol
